### Usage

Copy your project's source directory into `src/` and run `npm start`. ngLocalize will search for any `ng-bind` HTML attributes starting with `::i18n.` and add their values as keys to an i18n object. Tweak a few settings in app.js to add your own language keys. You can also use [quicktranslate](https://github.com/sparkpunk/quicktranslate) to make these translations for you.
